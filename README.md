# Considerations

Please upload your solution to GitHub or any file hosting system. It must have a readme.md file  that contains, at least:

* Basic description of your solution

I implemented the Tramoux algorythm which tries to go always in no stepped cells or in the less stepped cells.
Also, I saved the door position whenever I encountered it before all the 7 keys had been found in order to implement a
backtrack to the door.



# Evaluation criteria

#### Correctness 
The solution should solve the problem in the most practical way possible, ideally with no bugs or unhandled edge cases.

#### Design
OOP principles should be present throughout the solution. It should be simple, intuitive and easy to understand.

#### Performance
The solution should make optimal use of resources such as CPU, memory or disk.


#### Tests
Everything should be reasonably unit tested. Tests should guarantee correctness. Edge cases or negative flows should be also tested.
#### Documentation
Your code should be documented.


#### Maintainability -- desacoplada
The solution should be maintainable by a development team. This means, among other things, that it should be ready to accommodate future requirements with minimum effort.
#### Reusability   -- funciones
Whenever possible, parts of the solution should be ready to be reused in other similar problems. 
#### Simplicity
Solve the challenge with as less code as possible without sacrificing any of the above.

# Hints

Separation of concerns principles are always helpful.

Java sources should be documented with Javadoc. 

Test coverage reports would be a plus.

Functional programming is powerful! And Java supports some of it.

Recursiveness is fun but could get you in trouble here. Use at your own risk.

At first, the keeper does not know anything about the maze. It could start walking using any strategies and keeping track of the visited cells...

**Good luck!**
